#Limits

Why have limits?  They make it easier to design and implement an application.
They also encourage more creativity from the players.


Current limits:

1. The size of a planet is in the range [10,2000].
2. The size of the galaxy is in the range [10000, 100000].
3. Names of game elements are limited to 32 characters.
