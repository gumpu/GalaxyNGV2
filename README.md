#GalaxyNGV2

This is a reboot of GalaxyNG.

GalaxyNG is a play-by-email turn-based space strategy game.  Each player gets
to play one nation in a galaxy filled with many planets. Nations begin with
one or more populated home worlds and the other planets are empty.  The object
of the game is to conquer the galaxy by colonizing and developing uninhabited
planets, researching drive/weapons/shield/cargo technology, building warships
and attacking neighboring nations.

GalaxyNGV2 is a reboot of this game.  It will follow most of the original
rules, but have a new server and web-browser based (graphical) client.


##Name

The name is currently GalaxyNGV2 but that just a working name and is likely to
change.


##Technology

The server is written in Python and is as platform independent as possible.

The client technology is to be decided.  Most likely javascript / HTML5.

The plan is to have it available on as many platforms as possible.
